# Camify

**Camify**
Camify is a RubyGem that adds an accent onto any lowercase letters that you enter into it.

**Motivation**
I made this RubyGem during my time in the Flatiron School Web Immersive program to build a greater understanding of how gems work and are created. The inspiration for this gem are the cryptic looking social media posts made by Cam Newton.

ruby v2.3.3

**Installation**
You can download the Camify RubyGem at https://rubygems.org/gems/camify or in your terminal with 'gem install camify'. Add it to your Gemfile and use it in any project.

**How to use?**
To use Camify in a project create a new Camify object with Camify.new, run the method .process() with a string as an argument and your camified string will be returned.
